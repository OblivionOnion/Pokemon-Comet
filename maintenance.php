- Resetting. <br><i>Due to many people suggestioning a reset, and I also think it would be quite an idea, thats what I am doing. Also, I'm updating Register so that you can choose to show/hide your email and choose your starter. Aswell, Thanks to HuMaJuMa, we are going to have a new color scheme, I think everyone will love it.</i>
